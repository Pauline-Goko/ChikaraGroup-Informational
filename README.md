## Introduction

The CarbonGuard IoT device is a cutting-edge solution for actively monitoring vehicle carbon emissions. By strategically placing it within a vehicle's emission system, the device captures real-time Carbon Dioxide (CO2) data. This valuable information is then transmitted to a dashboard, which not only calculates carbon credits but also provides actionable insights to reduce each vehicle's carbon footprint.

Our solution uses data analytics to quantify the environmental impact of an organization's entire vehicle fleet. This ensures that each company is not only held accountable for its emissions but can also identify opportunities for efficiency and sustainability.
